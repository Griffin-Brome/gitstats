This exercise is very similar to the [individual git exercise](./git_exercise_individual.md).  Make sure each team member has completed that exercise before attempting this team exercise.

What to do for this Individual Git Exercise:

- Come up with a small programming project for yourself (write a sortable array in Java or something simple).
- Heave each team member set up git on your machine, create a Github account.
- Have the DevOps / Technical Lead [setup the github repository](./docs/technical/git_basics.md) for the [team git exercise](./docs/technical/git_exercise_team.md).  Some features require a pro github account, which can be obtained using [GitHub for Education](https://education.github.com/pack) and your school e-mail address.
- Think of at least 1 independent feature per team member that your project will accomplish.  Assign each team member one of these features.  For the sortable array, it could be sorting a list of integers and sorting a list of strings.
- Have each team member clone the repository locally.
- For each feature you are developing, have the assigned team member:
    - Switch to the master branch and pull master from the remote repository (origin).
    - Create a branch locally for the feature they are developing.
    - Switch to the correct feature branch, merge master into the feature branch (if required).
    - Push the new branch to GitHub and observe they exist in the branch list.
    - Develop the feature.  Make sure the feature works by testing it.  Commit it to the feature branch.
    - Make sure to create or update README.md with instructions on what your feature is and how to use it.
    - Push the feature branch to the remote repository (origin).
    - Create a pull request in GitHub from the feature branch to the master branch.
    - Resolve any merge conflicts by pulling master and merging into the feature branch onto your local machine.
    - Have another team member review the pull request.
    - Merge the pull request once the feature is complete.
    - Pull the master branch on your local machine and make sure it updates with the code from GitHub.

**Be ready to show this next class - that means you need to have your work on the machine ready for demo at the beginning of class.**

**Grading: will go towards your weekly progress measures**
