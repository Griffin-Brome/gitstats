# Individual Git Exercise

What to do for this Individual Git Exercise:

- Come up with a small programming project for yourself (write a sortable array in Java or something simple).
- Set up git on your machine, create a Github account, create a new repo for this project.
- Think of at least 2 independent features that your project will accomplish.  For the sortable array, it could be sorting a list of integers and sorting a list of strings.
- Clone the repository locally.
- Set up branches for each of these features; this means you must have at least three branches, including master.
- Push each of these new branches to GitHub and observe they exist in the branch list.
- For each feature you are developing:
    - Switch to the master branch and pull master from the remote repository (origin).
    - Switch to the correct feature branch, merge master into the feature branch, and develop the feature.  Make sure the feature works by testing it.  Commit it to the feature branch.
    - Make sure to create or update README.md with instructions on what your feature is and how to use it.
    - Push the feature branch to the remote repository (origin).
    - Create a pull request in GitHub from the feature branch to the master branch, and merge it.
    - Pull the master branch on your local machine and make sure it updates with the code from GitHub.

**Be ready to show this next class - that means you need to have your work on the machine ready for demo at the beginning of class.**

**Grading: will go towards your weekly progress measures**
