# Sprint Retrospective

One of the core [tenents of agile software development](./agile_manifesto.md) is continous improvement.  This is performed through regular [sprint retrospectives](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/how-run-sprint-retrospective/).  The purpose of the sprint restrospective is to identify process improvements which can improve the project's outcome.  

The sprint retrospective can take many forms, but it is common to have each team member member write down topics at the start of the meeting.  The scrum master then picks topics and promotes flow of the conversation.  Remember, the goal is to identify process improvements, so topics should be constructive and non-personal.  For example, rather than a topic "so-and-so didn't complete all their tasks", a topic is better phrased as "the team left tasks incomplete at the end of the sprint."  The discussion can then try to identify *why* these tasks were incomplete; perhaps it was because of poorly defined acceptance criteria, an unidentified technical hurdle, or the team member spent hours on running regression tests and integration issues rather than assigned tasks.  This is valuable insight and learning for the team to produce better tasks in the future.  Perhaps there is a positive return-on-investment for some automated testing that the team should agree to work on as a [chore](./docs/technical/issues.md).

General topics of conversation include:
- What the team did well
- What the team can improve on
- Kudos to a team member for a specific accomplishment

The outcome of a sprint retrospective should be meeting minutes, reviewed by the team and checked into the repository, including any action items the team agreed to take on.
