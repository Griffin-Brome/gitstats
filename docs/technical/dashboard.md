# Project Dashboard

The [Project Board](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards) helps you to manage the lifecycle of issues.  You will create a single *Basic Kanban* project board, which has three columns:

- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

During the [sprint planning](./planning.md) meetings, you will maintain this board to keep track of your team's highest-priority features, and assign them to team members to work on.  A team member can be assigned only one feature at a time, and that feature must be worked on until it is complete; a feature is complete when it is either implemented or abandoned.
