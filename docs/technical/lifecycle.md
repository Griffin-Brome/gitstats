# Software Development Lifecycle

The [software development lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle) defines a general process for creating software.  It consists of 5 steps: Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, and Maintenance.  There are many different implementations of this general lifecycle, but in this project we will adhere to the [agile](./agile_manifesto.md) methodology, where these steps are performed iteratively and repeated often.  This allows for quick adaptation to changing requirements and priorities.  Fast iteration requires small tasks that are [completed](./agile.md) often.

# Planning

## Requirements Gathering

Requirements are gathered from the client and logged as [user stories](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/user-story/) which are called features.  Features are not required to be completable in a single sprint.  These stories are put into the [backlog](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog/).  Each story is required to have [acceptance criteria](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/acceptance-criteria/), which are a definition of what the client would expect a completed deliverable to accomplish.

## Sprint Planning

During [sprint planning](./planning.md), features in the backlog are refined into deliverable tasks and accepted to be worked upon.  Each task is expected to take 2-4 hours to complete fully.  If it is unclear how to proceed with a feature, or how long a task will take, then [exploration](./visibility.md) must be performed; this exploration must be completable in the same timeline as a task, and produce a clear deliverable (e.g. pros-cons list or small prototype) which can be reviewed by the entire team.  Each task / exploration must have a clear outcome defined through acceptance criteria and validation techniques.  Validation techniques define *exactly* how you will guarantee that the acceptance criteria have been met; for code deliverables, for example, passing linter requirements, code review, and the creation of automated tests are common validation techniques.

The outcome of sprint planning is a list of tasks accepted into the sprint.  These tasks are well-defined, work towards the completion of features, and are expected to be completable during the sprint.  For example, if each tasks is 2-4 hours, sprints are one week long, and each member is expected to do 6 - 10 hours of work per week, then each member should be assigned 2-3 tasks at the start of each sprint.
