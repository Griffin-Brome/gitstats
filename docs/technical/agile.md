# Agile Software Development

Agile software development is founded on self-organizing, cross-functional teams which rapidly adapt to changing requirements in order to devliver valuable software to the customer quickly and frequently.  The values are principles are defined in the [agile manifesto](./agile_manifesto.md).

There are two common frameworks which are inspired by this manifesto: scrum and kanban.  [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) employs timeboxed sprints, with the scope of the sprint being agreed to by the team before starting, and the expectation that all work assigned be finished by a pre-determined time (usually after 2 - 4 weeks of work).  [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) mandates high visibility of progress as work is undertaken, and the agreement that tasks will not exceed capacity to maintain a sustainable work environment for all.  Often, Scrum and Kanban are used together, and this is the approach taken in the capstone projects.

## Definition of Done

Since agile is an iterative framework that encourages rapid changes in requirements, individual tasks are expected to be very small, and the team has a [definition of done](https://www.productplan.com/agile-definition-of-done/) which is expected to be met for all tasks.  In this case, tasks are expected to take 2-4 hours to complete, and the definition of done is as follows:

- The acceptance criteria are met and the validation techniques are satisfied
- Code is peer reviewed
- Code is merged to develop via Pull Request
- develop is merged to master via Pull Request
- Code/feature passes regression testing
- Code/feature passes smoke testing
- Code is documented inline with PyDoc, JSDoc, JavaDoc or similar.
- Technical documentation is updated for system-level decisions / diagrams
