This repository documents how to use the [GitHub project management](https://github.com/features/project-management) features to support an agile methodology.  It also provides code which uses [PyGithub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) to query the [API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to track project progess and contributions for team members.

# Getting Stared

1) Make sure you understand [agile](./docs/technical/agile.md) and read the [manifesto](./docs/technical/agile_manifesto.md).  Also, read and understand the overview of the [software development lifecycle](./docs/technical/lifecycle.md).

2) As a team, understand the [roles](./docs/technical/roles.md) and agree on each member's role for the duration of the project.

3) Setup the github repository and configure it to enforce proper [git flow](/docs/technical/git.md).  Some features require a pro github account, which can be obtained using [GitHub for Education](https://education.github.com/pack) and your school e-mail address.

4) Configure the [GitHub issue labels](./docs/technical/visibility.md) needed.

5) Schedule your first client meeting.  When you meet your client for the first time, introduce yourselves as well as your roles in the project. While your objective is to learn who your client is and the project details, you will need to keep in mind that your client is most likely not familiar with how this course works or what is expected of you or of them. Explain to them there is a course schedule and there are intermediate reports that will be created as part of the project that you will go over with them upon completion.

5) Schedule your first team meeting.  Record the minutes of the first client meeting in the repostory.  Record the features requested by the client as user stories using [GitHub issues](./docs/technical/visibility.md).

6) Perform your first sprint planning meeting, where you divide features into tasks and record any [exploration](./docs/technical/visibility.md) that needs to be performed before proceeding with coding work.  Each task should be expected to take 2-4 hours, and exploration should be undertaken until this is possible.

# Weekly Expectations

- Have a team meeting where you perform a [retrospective](https://youtu.be/MiaZhJyYUj0) and [sprint planning](./docs/technical/planning.md)
